# C Programming Showcase

Welcome to my **C Programming Repository**! 🚀

This repository serves as a **portfolio** of my journey as I learn and improve my skills in the **C programming language**. Here, I will be uploading various C programs, ranging from beginner-friendly exercises to more advanced projects as I progress.

## 🔹 About This Repository
- 📌 **Purpose:** To document my learning, showcase my skills, and track my progress in C programming.
- 💡 **Topics Covered:**
  - Basic syntax and data types
  - Loops and conditional statements
  - Functions and recursion
  - Pointers and memory management
  - File handling
  - Data structures and algorithms
- 🛠 **Projects:** I will also include small projects to demonstrate practical applications of C.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
/                      # Root directory
│── basics/            # Simple C programs for fundamental concepts
│── data-structures/   # Implementations of linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
│── algorithms/        # Sorting, searching, and other algorithmic programs
│── projects/         # Small projects to demonstrate real-world applications
│── README.md         # This file
```

## 🔧 How to Run the Code
To compile and run any of my C programs:
```sh
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```
Make sure you have **GCC** installed, or use an online compiler like [Replit](https://replit.com/) or [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/).

## 🌱 Future Plans
- Improve my problem-solving skills by implementing more algorithms.
- Work on mini-projects that showcase real-world applications.
- Experiment with **file handling**, **multithreading**, and **system programming**.

## 📢 Feedback & Suggestions
If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to **reach out** or **open an issue** in this repository.
